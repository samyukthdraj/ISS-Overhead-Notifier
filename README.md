# ISS Overhead Notifier

This Python script checks if the International Space Station (ISS) is currently overhead your location and if it's nighttime. If both conditions are met (ISS is overhead and it's night), you can extend the script to send an email notification (though email functionality is currently commented out).

## Features

* **ISS Position Check:** Determines the current longitude and latitude of the ISS.
* **Nighttime Check:** Detects if it is currently nighttime at your specified location using sunrise and sunset times.
* **Overhead Detection:** Checks if the ISS is within a specified range (+/- 5 degrees) of your location.
* **Placeholder for Email Notification:**  Includes commented-out sections for potential email functionality using SMTP (not implemented in the current version).

## Usage

1. **Clone the Repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/iss-notifier.git
Use code with caution.
Markdown
Navigate to the Project Directory:

cd iss-notifier
Use code with caution.
Bash
Install Dependencies (requests):

pip install requests
Use code with caution.
Bash
Configure Your Location:

Open the Python script (e.g., iss_notifier.py).

Find the LAT and LONG variables.

Replace the placeholder values with the latitude and longitude of your location.

Run the Script:

python iss_notifier.py
Use code with caution.
Bash
The script will currently only print debugging information if the ISS is overhead and it's night. You will need to uncomment and implement the email functionality for actual notifications.

Implementation Notes (Extending the Script)
Email Notifications:

To enable email notifications, you'll need to:

Uncomment the import smtp and import time lines.

Provide your email credentials (mymail and mypass) correctly.

Implement the email sending logic using smtp or a similar email library within the conditional checks.

Error Handling:

The current script uses response.raise_for_status() to check for HTTP errors. You can add more robust error handling and logging to make the script more resilient.

Dependencies
Python 3.x: Ensure you have Python 3.x installed on your system.

requests: Used for making HTTP requests to the ISS and sunrise-sunset APIs.

datetime: Used for working with dates and times.

smtp (if email functionality is implemented).

time (if email functionality includes delays or scheduling).

Project Structure
your_script_name.py (e.g., iss_notifier.py): The main Python script for the application.

Contributions are encouraged! If you want to improve the script, add email functionality, or enhance the error handling, feel free to:

Acknowledgments
Open Notify API: Thanks to the Open Notify API for providing real-time ISS position data.

Sunrise-Sunset API: Thanks to the Sunrise-Sunset API for providing sunrise and sunset times based on location.

Remember to replace the placeholders like your-username, your_script_name.py, and add a license if desired.

**Important:**

* **Email Credentials:** Be very careful when adding your email credentials to any script. Make sure you understand the security implications and consider using environment variables or other secure methods to store sensitive information instead of hardcoding them directly into the script.
* **Error Handling:** The current script is basic. For production use, you'll want to add more robust error handling and logging to capture any potential issues during API requests or other operations.
* **Testing:** Thoroughly test the script and any modifications you make to ensure it works correctly and sends notifications as expected.
